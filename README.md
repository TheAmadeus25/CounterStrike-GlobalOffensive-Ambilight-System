# CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-Ambilight-System
This Add-on control **WS2812B** LED strip, based on your **in-game** stats like health, armor, and many more. It make use of the **[official API from Valve](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration#Sample_HTTP_POST_Endpoint_Server)** and need a modified version of this script. You can find it **[here](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio)** which work for streaming software like OBS *(and similar)*, aswell. It does require **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** which act like a server for the game and the ESP8266. Beside, it has some pre-defined Ambilight Layout which can change by pressing the FLASH-Button on the ESP8266.

‚ùó **At the moment, it use TCP instead of UDP, which has a huge *(negativ)* impact for the reaction. It will be changed later.**

‚ùó‚ùó **Read the [Wiki]() how to install it.**

üí¨ **Official VAC Review pending!** *(Still waiting)*
