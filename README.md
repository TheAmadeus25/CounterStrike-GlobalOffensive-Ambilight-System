# CounterStrike GlobalOffensive - Ambilight-System
This Add-on control **WS2812B** LED strip, based on your **In-Game** stats like health, armor, and many more. It make use of the **[official API from Valve](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration#Sample_HTTP_POST_Endpoint_Server)** and need a modified version of the script. You can find it **[here](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-LiveStat-for-OBS-Studio)** which work for streaming software like OBS *(and similar)*, aswell. It does require **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** which act like a server for the game and the ESP8266. Beside, it has some pre-defined Ambilight Layout which can change by pressing the FLASH-Button on the ESP8266. But there is more, it works **WIRELESS!** Theoretical, you can attach as many LED's as you wish. You need to add the IP inside the script, but I'll make a wiki for it.

‚úî **It use UDP, which has real-time reaction!**

‚ùó **Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/TheAmadeus25/CounterStrike-GlobalOffensive-Ambilight-System/wiki) how to install it. NOTE: The Wiki isn't finished but I can't write until this Repository is released. I do Copy&Past at the moment xD**

üí¨ **Official VAC Review pending!** *(Still waiting)*
